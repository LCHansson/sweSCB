DEVELOPMENT INSTRUCTIONS
========================

Branching
---------
The 'master' branch is considered stable. DO NOT MAKE COMMITS TO THE 'master' BRANCH WITHOUT DUE PERMISSION.

Development is done in the 'dev' branch. Before release, 'dev' is forked into a 'x.y-beta' branch where only fixes and really minor changes are allowed. When the 'x.y-beta' branch is deemed release ready by the core dev team (currently: Love Hansson, MÃ¥ns Magnusson), the branch is merged into 'master' and turned into the new stable release.

Hotfixes (i.e. bugfixes and bugfixes only) happen in 'x.y-hotfix_z' branches forked from the 'master' branch where 'z' designates the GitHub issue containing the bug report being adressed.


Version numbering
-----------------
Versions are numbered x.y, where 'x' are full releases (i.e. significant feature changes etc.) and 'y' are minor releases (i.e. bug fixes, minor feature improvements, small adjustments).


Commit instructions
-------------------
If you are not a part of the core development team, please submit your code in the form of pull requests. These will be duly reviewed as soon as possible. Please be patient.

Commit early, and commit often. But please keep commits clean, i.e. try to focus on one functionality per commit if possible.

Please do not commit any changes to any other branch than the 'dev' branch unless explicitly tasked with working on another branch.


Building
--------
Before making a pull request, make sure your code builds. We use `roxygen2` for package building.

DO NOT commit .Rd manpages in the 'dev' branch! Manpages may be added to the '*-beta' branches and must definitely be added to the 'master' branch before committing.
